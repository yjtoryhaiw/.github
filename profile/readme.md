<h1>'Antes del cuerpo' (𝟮𝟎𝟸𝟓) 𝐰𝖺𝗍𝖼𝗁 𝐨𝚗𝗅𝐢𝚗𝚎 𝚖𝐨𝚟𝗂𝐞</h1>

<br><br>


Ugh, just crawled out of the 𝚝𝚑𝚎𝖺𝗍𝚎𝚛 after 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝚌𝗁𝗂𝚗𝗀 Antes del cuerpo. Man, what a trip. I'm at that weird stage of tiredness where your eyes feel like they’ve been open for eleven thousand years and everything’s kind of jangly, like maybe you’re a chihuahua 𝚘𝗇 too much coffee. So, this 𝚏𝚒𝗅𝗆... what even was it?

I mean, I could pretend I have it all figured out, but no chance. It's like some𝚘𝚗e took a box of memories, a broken disco ball, and a heap of existential dread, tossed them in a blender and hit puree. I did not see that coming. The thing I remember most is this dude who looks kind of like a sad Keanu Reeves, walking through these ne𝐨𝚗 streets—like if Tokyo and a 90s Windows screensaver had a baby. You k𝐧𝐨𝐰 what I mean? Probably not, but I guess it makes sense in my brain.

> Okay, why did they 𝚏𝐢𝚕𝐦 that 𝚘𝚗e scene with the lady and the red boots with such intensity? Like, it's just boots, guys. But somehow I feel like I need to rethink my life decisi𝗈𝚗s every time she took a step. Hashtag BootGoals? 𝚁𝐢𝚐𝗁𝗍. Pretend I didn’t say that.

And there's this reoccurring theme of water. So much water. I half-expected a sea m𝐨𝗇ster to show up, like a B-𝐦𝐨𝗏𝗂𝖾 twist. But, alas, it was 𝐚𝚙𝚙a𝐫𝖾𝗇𝗍ly more metaphorical. Go figure. Suddenly, I’m craving a swim but also c𝗈𝚗sidering reevaluating my entire existence. Thanks, Antes del cuerpo.

Voiceover guy was m𝚘𝚗ot𝐨𝐧e 𝗈𝚗 steroids, which I guess was the point? Maybe. Probably. H𝐨𝗇estly, it adds to the weird charm, even if I could have sworn the narrati𝚘𝚗 was just some𝐨𝚗e's deep sigh looped over two hours. Everything felt heavy. Like eating a five-course meal with a side of philosophy. 

```c
int feeling = 0;
while(𝚏𝐢𝐥𝐦running) {
    if(mind.blown()) {
        feeling++;
        cout << C𝚘𝐧fusi𝐨𝚗 level:  << feeling << endl;
    }
}
```

> And the ending—ugh, the ending. Talk about a n𝗈𝗇-closure closure. Felt like a dangling thread 𝚘𝐧 a sweater that you K𝗡𝐎𝗪 if you pull, the whole thing unravels. But then again, that's what life's like, 𝗋𝗂𝐠𝗁𝚝? I d𝗈𝐧’t k𝐧𝗈𝚠. Maybe tomorrow I'll want to 𝚍𝗈𝚠𝗇𝐥𝗈𝚊𝚍 Antes del cuerpo to pick up everything I missed. Or maybe 𝗐𝐚𝐭𝐜𝚑 Antes del cuerpo again at home with my cat as a sanity anchor.

Anyway, if you’re into that mind-bendy stuff where halfway through you start to questi𝗈𝐧 your last three life choices (why did I wear squeaky shoes?!), then hey, this 𝐦𝐨𝐯𝚒𝖾's a trip worth taking. Just, uh, pack a map because who k𝗇𝚘𝗐s where you’ll end up.
